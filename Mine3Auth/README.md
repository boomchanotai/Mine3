## Technical Information

- **Login Token Storage**: Redis is used to store login tokens securely.
- **Player Cache Data**: The plugin stores player cache data by calling `void setPlayer(Address address, Player player)` from **Mine3Lib**, integrating with **Mine3Lib**â€™s data management system.
- **HTTP Handling**: Javalin is employed as the HTTP handler to verify signatures and act as the trigger point for player authentication.

This setup ensures secure and efficient management of player data and authentication processes within the Mine3 ecosystem.
